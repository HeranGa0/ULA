##ULA
Save our professors! â€” Our team's project in swamp hack 2019. 
## Inspiration
Have you used ratemyprofessor.com? It might be a handy tool for course decision but does not seem enough to satisfy our need sometimes: inaccuracy, lack of data, etc. We, as a university student and a programmer, wanted to solve that issue and create an alternative to fully satisfy the students who really care about their university life.

## What it does
This application quantify all the given and collected data to provide objective view toward courses for students. It also provides incentives to students who participate for data collection. Furthermore, it recommends or provides relative courses based on student's preference (this function has not been finished so far).

## How we built it
jQuery and JavaScript were used to for front-end. Node.js, Express and React were used for back-end job. We used MongoDB to store the user data.

## Challenges we ran into
The project was bigger than we thought: we needed huge amount of data, we needed to build server, database, and api's for data-transfer, we needed to create multiple pages for our website.
So, we planned to use dummy data for our demo because we do not have enough time and people to collect it. We also planned to skip few web pages which are not necessary for demo to save time. However, we put considerable amount of time on design of each page because clear interface design helps readers to interpret the information more quickly.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We believe that we've done a great job on establishing a decent business model which is subscription-based.

## What we learned
We have learned that time management and setting a specific goal are critical to complete a project successfully. 

## What's next for University Life Advisor (ULA)
The main purpose of this application is to provide the best chance to enhance students' university life. So far, the website lacks the proper algorithm to project the user data to the measurements. Therefore, we need to work on this part to provide more accurate and reasonable measurements to help students to make smarter decisions.
